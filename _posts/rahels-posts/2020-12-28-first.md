Hi and a warm welcome to my personal website. 

I am a young researcher and doctoral student at the University of Geneva (with the [Department of Public International Law and International Organization](https://www.unige.ch/droit/index.php?cID=1569)), where I am currently writing my doctoral thesis in international environmental law under the supervision of [Prof. Makane Moïse Mbengue](https://www.unige.ch/droit/index.php?cID=1029).

I discovered my passion for international environmental law in my master’s studies at the [University of Lucerne](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-law/), where I took my first course on this subject with [Prof. Thilo Marauhn](https://www.uni-giessen.de/fbz/fb01/professuren-forschung/professuren/marauhn/team/prof_leitung/index_html). He was also the supervisor of my master thesis "The WHO as actor in international environmental law? - An analysis by example of the international waste law", in which I analysed the interplay between environmental and health aspects in environmental issues such as waste and examined what potential the WHO has as an actor in international environmental law. In October 2021, my first article, which is based on the outcomes of my master thesis, was published in the [Review of European, Comparative and International Environmental Law (RECIEL)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/reel.12415). It advocates an advancement of the "One Health" approach.

My current research focuses on the report of the UN Secretary-General "[Gaps in international environmental law and environment related instruments: towards a global pact for the environment](https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/27070)" and on different approaches to make international environmental law more effective. It is my firm conviction that profound changes are needed in international environmental law and environmental governance to preserve our earth for future generations. 

Alongside my doctorate, I work as a jurist in the legal department of an environmental management consultancy. Dance, music and being outside in nature give me balance in life.
